# Unblock-US Mac

This is a simple personal Ruby script/GUI I use to set and unset Unblock-Us.com DNS settings for Netflix.

## Usage (Command Line)

```bash
ruby unblock-us.rb
```

1. Pick your network
2. Rest is done for you... the script will unset or set depending on the current DNS settings of the chosen network service

## Usage (GUI)

1. Extract the `tar.gz` archive in this repository
2. Open `UnblockUsGui.app`
3. Pick your network
4. Enter your system password
5. Done

The GUI is written and packaged with Ruby Shoes GUI Toolkit.
