# Unblock-US Mac

This is a simple personal Ruby script I use to set and unset Unblock-Us.com DNS settings for Netflix.

## Usage

```bash
ruby unblock-us.rb
```

1. Pick your network
2. Rest is done for you... the script will unset or set depending on the current DNS settings of the chosen network service
